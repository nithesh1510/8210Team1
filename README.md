# Good Shepherd Food Pantry

## Organization Overview
Good Shepherd Food Pantry Inc - Is a fictitious not-for-profit organization in Omaha Nebraska that provides low income members of the community with emergency food relief.  They have operated the organization for many years in the same downtown location. 
 
## Summary of Business Problem
The primary community donors of goods and cash donations are asking for more reporting on information about their clients and how they are served.  If they are repeat visitors to the emergency food pantry, are they being referred to other agencies to help them with problems in their lives and to help them find employment so they can support themselves. Today this is all being tracked on paper forms and in an Excel spreadsheet.  Today, there is no tracking of what items clients are asking for and what they actually take with them after the visit. 
The idea is to have several PCâ€™s which can be used to register a client and then determine what the client wanted but could not find at the pantry and the items they will be taken during a visit will be scanned in during visit. It is hoped that the additional data collection will help the pantry to do a better job of moving their clients out of poverty.
